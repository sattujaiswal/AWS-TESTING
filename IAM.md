Detailed Scenario-Based Questions with Answers

Scenario 1: Granting Temporary Access to External Users

Question: How would you grant temporary access to AWS resources for an external user?
Answer:

	•	Create an IAM role with the required permissions.
	•	Set up a trust policy to allow the external user’s AWS account to assume the role.
	•	Use AWS Security Token Service (STS) to generate temporary security credentials for the external user.

Scenario 2: Managing IAM Roles for EC2 Instances

Question: Describe the process to create and manage IAM roles for an application running on EC2 instances.
Answer:

	•	Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for the EC2 instance.
	•	Attach an inline or managed policy to the role specifying the required permissions.
	•	Modify the trust policy of the role to allow the EC2 service to assume the role.
	•	Launch or update the EC2 instance to associate it with the IAM role.

Scenario 3: Read-Only Access to S3 Bucket

Question: A developer needs read-only access to a specific S3 bucket. How would you set this up?
Answer:

	•	Create an IAM policy with read-only permissions for the specific S3 bucket:
         {
            "Version": "2012-10-17",
            "Statement": [
                {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": [
                    "s3:GetObject",
                    "s3:ListBucket"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name",
                    "arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*"
                ]
                }
            ]
            }

	Attach this policy to the developer’s IAM user or group.

Scenario 4: Region-Specific Access

Question: How can you ensure that an IAM user can only access resources in a specific region?
Answer:

	•	Create a policy with a condition that restricts access based on the aws:RequestedRegion key:
            {
                "Version": "2012-10-17",
                "Statement": [
                    {
                    "Effect": "Allow",
                    "Action": "*",
                    "Resource": "*",
                    "Condition": {
                        "StringEquals": {
                        "aws:RequestedRegion": "us-west-2"
                        }
                        }
                    }
                             ]
             }

    	Attach this policy to the IAM user or group.

Scenario 5: Organizing Permissions for a Development Team

Question: You have a development team that needs different levels of access to various AWS services. How would you organize users, groups, and roles to manage their permissions effectively?
Answer:

	•	Create IAM groups based on job functions (e.g., Developers, Admins).
	•	Attach appropriate managed policies to each group.
	•	Create IAM users for each team member and add them to the appropriate groups.
	•	Use roles for temporary or cross-account access when needed.

Scenario 6: Multiple Roles for a Single User

Question: How do you handle a situation where an IAM user needs to assume multiple roles?
Answer:

	•	Ensure that the user’s IAM policy grants permission to use the sts:AssumeRole action for the required roles.
	•	The user can then assume different roles as needed using the AWS CLI, SDKs, or AWS Management Console.

Scenario 7: Policy with Condition Key

Question: Describe a scenario where you would use an IAM policy with a condition key.
Answer:

	•	Use a condition key to restrict access based on factors such as IP address, time of day, or specific AWS services.
	•	Example: Restricting access to a specific IP range:
             {
                 "Version": "2012-10-17",
                 "Statement": [
                {
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Action": "*",
                "Resource": "*",
                "Condition": {
                    "IpAddress": {
                    "aws:SourceIp": "203.0.113.0/24"
                    }
                }
                }
              ]
            }

Scenario 8: Lambda Function Accessing DynamoDB

Question: How can you enable a Lambda function to access a DynamoDB table using IAM roles?
Answer:

	•	Create an IAM role with a policy that grants the necessary permissions for the DynamoDB table.
	•	Attach the role to the Lambda function.
	•	Example policy:
    {
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:PutItem"
      ],
      "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-west-2:123456789012:table/YourTableName"
    }
  ]
}

Scenario 9: Compromised Access Key

Question: What steps would you take if an IAM user’s access key is compromised?
Answer:

	•	Immediately deactivate the compromised access key.
	•	Rotate the access key by creating a new key and updating applications to use the new key.
	•	Monitor AWS CloudTrail logs for any suspicious activity.
	•	Review and update security policies to prevent future incidents.

Scenario 10: ECS Cluster Access

Question: How can you use IAM roles to allow an application running on an ECS cluster to access other AWS services?
Answer:

	•	Create an IAM role with the necessary permissions for the services the ECS tasks need to access.
	•	Update the ECS task definition to specify the role.
	•	Ensure the trust policy of the role allows the ECS service to assume the role.
